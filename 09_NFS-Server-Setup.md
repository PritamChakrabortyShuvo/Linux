# Setting Up NFS Server and Client on Ubuntu

## What is Linux NFS (Network File System) Server?
The Network File System (NFS) allows us to share directories & files with other Linux clients over a network. It enables users to mount remote directories on their system as if they were local folders making it useful for centralizing file management and sharing resources.
