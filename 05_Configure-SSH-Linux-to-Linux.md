# SSH (Secure Shell) on a Linux-to-Linux systemüîê
## What is SSH?
**SSH** or **Secure Shell** is a network protocol that allows secure communication between two computers. It is commonly used for accessing and managing servers remotely.

## SSH Architecture
SSH (Secure Shell) uses **public-key cryptography** to authenticate the remote system and the user trying to connect. It operates on three layers:

  - **Transport Layer:** Handles server authentication, confidentiality & integrity. It also manages port 22 which is the default port for SSH.
  - **User Authentication Layer:** Confirms if the user is recognized by the server and verifies the credentials using various authentication algorithms.
  - **Connection Layer:** Creates an encrypted communication tunnel and splits it into multiple logical channels for different interactions.

These layers work together to securely establish an SSH connection.

Here is a first diagram explaining the summarized steps made during the SSH connection initialization.

The **client and the server** **validate their mutual keys** and **open a secured tunnel to proceed**.

Here is the detailed steps :
  - The client initiates a **TCP connection** to the **SSH server** on **port 22** (default reserved port).
  - The server responds to the client‚Äôs connection and they establish a **TCP handshake**.
  - The server sends its **identification string** to the client with various informations (protocol version, etc).
  - The client sends its own **identification informations** to the server using the same format.
  - Once the identification strings have been exchanged, the **server sends its public key to the client**.
  - If the server is not in the **`‚Äúknown_hosts‚Äù`** file of the client it will **prompt the user if they can trust it or not**. If **yes**, **the server will be added into the list**.
  - If **not**, **this question will prompted everytime**.
  - The **client generates a random session key** and **encrypt it with the server‚Äôs public key**.
  - The **server decrypts the session key** using its **private key**.
  - The connection between the **client and the server** is now secured by encrypting each data using the session key.
  
In short, the client and server exchange keys and secure the connection for safe communication.

## Configuration of SSH
### Workflow

</div>


### Step 1 : Install SSH on Ubuntu
The **`openssh-server`** package is need to be installed to enable **SSH** access to the server.
```bash
    sudo apt update
```
```bash
    sudo apt install openssh-server
```
### Step 2 : Start and Enable SSH Service
After installation the SSH service is started & enabled to run at boot.
```bash
    sudo systemctl status ssh
```
```bash
    sudo systemctl enable --now ssh
```
Verify that the service is running successfully & enable service.

### Step 3 : Configure custom SSH
The default **SSH port 22** is changed for security reasons & other settings are adjusted to improve security such as disabling empty passwords root login & password-based authentication.
#### Backup SSH Configuration File
Before modifying the SSH configuration it is a best practice to **back up the original configuration file** to **avoid accidental misconfiguration**.
```bash
    sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config_backup
```
#### Open the SSH Configuration File
Edit the SSH configuration file using a text editor.
```bash
    sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
#### Security Settings for SSH Configuration
1. **Disable Empty Paswword :**
By setting **`PermitEmptyPasswords no`** we ensure that no user with an **empty password** can log in via SSH. This prevents unauthorized access from accounts with no password.
```bash
    PermitEmptyPasswords no
```
2. **Change Default SSH Port**
The default **SSH port is 22**. Changing it to a custom port can reduce the number of **brute-force attacks** targeting port 22.
```bash
    port 1646
```
3. **Disable Root Login**
Disabling **root login** via SSH prevents direct **root access** & forces users to log in with a **regular user account** & then use **`sudo`** for **administrative tasks**.
```bash
    PermitRootLogin no
```
4. **Set Idle Timeout** 
The **`ClientAliveInterval`** option defines the idle timeout interval in seconds. Here setting it to **300 seconds (5 minutes)** will **log out** **inactive users** after this time period.
```bash
    ClientAliveInterval 300
```
5. **Disable SSH Protocol 1**
SSH has **two versions 1 and 2**. **Version 1 is outdated and less secure**. Disabling it by **setting Protocol 2** ensures only the **more secure protocol is used.**
```bash
    Protocol 2
```
6. **Allow Selected Users**
We can restrict SSH access to specific users by using the **`AllowUsers directive`**. Replace **User_name01** and **User_name02** with the actual usernames we want to allow SSH access.
```bash
    AllowUsers User_name01 User_name02
```
7. **Disable Password-Based Login**
To enhance security further especially if we are using SSH keys for authentication we can disable password-based logins.
```bash
    PasswordAuthentication no
```
### Step 4 : Allow SSH Through the Firewall
The **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** is configured to allow **incoming connections** on the **custom SSH port**.
```bash
    sudo ufw allow from any to any port 2222 proto tcp
```
### Step 5 : Restart SSH Service
After making changes restart the SSH service to apply the changes.
```bash
    sudo systemctl restart ssh
```
### Step 6 : Connecting to the Server
Once SSH is configured we can connect to the server using the **`ssh`** command from another **Linux machine (Local)**.
#### Check if SSH Client is Installed
Most Linux systems come with the SSH client pre-installed. However if it is not installed we can do so using the following command.
```bash
    sudo apt install openssh-client
```
#### Find the IP Address of the Remote System
To connect via SSH we need the **IP address** of the **Server**. We can find it by running the **`ifconfig`** or **`ip addr`** command on the **Server**.
#### Connect to the Server
Once we have the IP address use the following command to connect to the server. Replace username with the actual username of the server & IPaddress with the server's IP.
```bash
    ssh username@IPaddress
```
#### Connect to a Custom SSH Port
If SSH is configured to use a **custom port** (not the default port 22) specify the port using the **`-p`** option.
```bash
    ssh username@IPaddress -p portnumber
```
### Steps 7 : Enable, Disable or Status check
In Ubuntu 24.04 (and newer) managing services like **SSH** is done using **`systemctl`** which is part of **systemd** the system and service manager. Here's a breakdown of how to **enable**, **disable** or **check the status** of the SSH service using **`systemctl`**
#### Check SSH Status
This command will show us whether the SSH service is active (running) or inactive (stopped).
```bash
    sudo systemctl status ssh
```
#### Start SSH Service
To start the SSH service (for example, after stopping it) use this command.
```bash
    sudo systemctl start ssh
```
#### Stop SSH Service
If we want to stop the SSH service use this command. This will temporarily disable SSH until we start it again.
```bash
    sudo systemctl stop ssh
```
#### Enable SSH at Boot
To ensure SSH starts automatically every time the system boots, use the following command. This sets SSH to start on boot.
```bash
    sudo systemctl enable ssh
```
#### Disable SSH at Boot
To prevent SSH from starting automatically at boot use this command. We might use this if we don‚Äôt want the SSH service running after every reboot.
```bash
    sudo systemctl disable ssh
```
